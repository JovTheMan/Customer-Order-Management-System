# Customer-Order-Management-System

A coffee shop wants to automate their customer order process. They need a system that: 1. Takes customer orders and adds them to the list of current orders. 2. Calculates the total amount due for each customer based on their order. 3. Manages the inventory, ensuring there are enough products available to fulfill orders. 4. Tracks the status of orders (Pending, Completed).
